Smart Healthcare Monitoring System in IoT Cloud

The Internet of Things (IoT) is essential in innovative applications such as smart cities,
smart homes, education, healthcare, transportation, and defense operations. IoT 
applications are particularly beneficial for providing healthcare because they enable secure
and real-time remote patient monitoring to improve the quality of people’s lives. This
review paper explores the latest trends in healthcare-monitoring systems by implementing 
the role of the IoT. The work discusses the benefits of IoT-based healthcare systems
with regard to their significance, and the benefits of IoT healthcare. We provide a 
systematic review on recent studies of IoT-based healthcare-monitoring systems through
literature review. The literature review compares various systems’ effectiveness,efficiency, data protection, privacy, security, and monitoring. 
The paper also explores wireless- and wearable-sensorbased IoT monitoring systems and provides a classification of healthcare-monitoring sensors. We also elaborate, in detail, on the challenges
and open issues regarding healthcare security and privacy, and QoS. Finally, 
suggestions and recommendations for IoT healthcare applications are laid down at the end of
the study along with future directions related to various recent technology trends.
Our project is a working model which incorporates sensors to measure parameters
